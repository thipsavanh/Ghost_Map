 # Project 1
 
<h1>MVP</h1>
<p>
 An app that pulls up crime data based on location.
 </p>
 <h2>Project Description</h2>
 <p>Creating an app that uses a user's current location and alerts them if there are any 'ghosts' near them. A ghost is someone who was murdered. To accomplish this we will be using the Chicago Public Database API to access crime. We will also be using the Google Maps API to show users directions to ghosts' locations. We will place a ghost icon on the location of a murder and users can click on the icon for information on the crime.</p>
 
 <h2>User Story</h2>
 <p>I am a true crime enthusiast/ghosthunter/pagan. <br>I want to know if there are any crimes/ghosts near me. <br>I want to know the history of that crime/ghost. <br>If I am scared of ghosts I want my route to take me a way there are no ghosts. <br>
