<h1>MVP</h1>
<p>
 An app that pulls up crime data based on location.
 </p>
 <h2>Project Description</h2>
 <p>Creating an app that uses a users current location and alerts them if there are any 'ghosts' near them. A ghost is someone who was murdered. To accomplish this we will be using the Crimeometer API to access crime location by type and location. We will also be using the Google Maps API to show users directions to ghosts' locations. We will place a ghost icon on the location of a murder and users can hover over the icon for information on the crime.</p>
 
 <h2>User Story</h2>
 <p>I am a ghost enthusiast. <br>I want to know if there are any ghosts near me. <br>I want to know the history of that ghost. <br>If I am scared of ghosts I want my route to take me a way there are no ghosts. <br>
