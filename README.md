<h1>MVP</h1>
<p>
 An app that pulls up crime data based on location.
 </p>
 <h2>Project Description</h2>
 <p>Creating an app that uses a users current location and alerts them if there are any 'ghosts' near them. A ghost is someone who was murdered. To accomplish this we will be using the Crimeometer API to access crime location by type and location. We will place a ghost icon on the location of a murder</p>
 
 <h2>User Stroy</h2>
 <p>I am a ghost enthusiast. <br>I want to know if there are any ghosts near me. <br>I want to know the history of that ghost. <br>If I am scared of ghosts I want my route to take me a way there are no ghosts. <br>
